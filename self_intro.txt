product introduction:

CloudHive, developed by Hillstone Network Technology, is a security protection product designed for cloud platforms, both public and private. It is deployed in the form of virtual machines, utilizing patented flow control technology to achieve micro-isolation between virtual machines. CloudHive offers users comprehensive cloud security services, including threat detection and isolation between virtual machines, as well as between virtual machines and the external network. It also provides traffic, application, and threat visualization, network attack auditing, and traceability.

CloudHive is a software product that is deployed in virtual machine form within a cloud platform. It consists of four types of virtual machines: vSOM, vSCM, vSSM, and vDSM (optional). The vSOM virtual security orchestration module manages the entire lifecycle of the CloudHive security service. The vSCM virtual security control module is responsible for security configuration management and scheduling of virtual security business modules. It is typically deployed redundantly to avoid single-point failures and improve reliability. The vSSM virtual security service module is responsible for executing specific security functions, such as access control and attack prevention. Deploying a vSSM on each physical server that requires protection will ensure that all virtual machines on that server are protected. Up to 200 vSSM virtual security service modules can be deployed, supporting cloud data centers with up to 200 physical servers.
